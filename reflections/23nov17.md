L1

1.1 
In 'Course Intro' I met Lorenzo, my teacher. I will learn how to make my own
data-driven web-app while helping him create a menu-app.
He presented the whole course structure:
L1 - I will learn to extract data from a DB using python and how to use ORM;
L2 - I will build my first DDWA;
L3 - I will create an app using the Flask framework;
L4 - I will use the knowledge acquired in the first 3 lessons to build a 
		polished web-app with API endpoints for JSON requests;


1.2
In 'Prerequisites and Preparation' we discussed some of the necessary 
technologies I should be familiar with in order to get the most out of this 
course:

-> basic Python: classes, methods, inheritance
-> sql statements
-> html, css & js
-> unix comand-line
-> VagrantMachine


1.13
"Creating a DB and ORMs" - I was walked through the process of making a 
DB layout for the menu-app. I also learned that in order to enhance 
comunication between python and a DB, people developed a tool called 
ORM(Object-Relational Mapping), which treats SQL queries as object, instead
of sending them as strings, since thus we are prone to typing errors that
cannot be detected by our compiler

1.14->1.17 I learned about each composing element of the database_setup.py
file.

Notes
===============================================================================
L1-2:
Once it is up and running, type 'vagrant ssh'. This will log your terminal into 
the virtual machine, and you'll get a Linux shell prompt. 
When you want to log out, type 'exit' at the shell prompt. 
To turn the virtual machine off (without deleting anything), type 
'vagrant halt'.
If you do this, you'll need to run vagrant up again before you can log into it.
